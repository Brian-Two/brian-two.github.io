### Weekly Journal Entry: 7/29 - 7/31


This week marked the conclusion of our project, focusing on final mapping tasks, preparing for presentations, and wrapping up the program. Significant progress was made in mapping and localization, and the culmination of our efforts was presented successfully.

**Accomplishments:**

- **Room Mapping and Localization**: Successfully mapped the room twice and saved the maps. The robot was then localized within these maps, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SLAM setup.
- **Presentation Preparation**: Created and edited a video demonstration, prepared VSlam slides, and contributed to the group research paper.
- **Project Presentation**: Delivered the end-of-program presentation, showcasing our project's progress and results to peers and mentors.

**Results Achieved:**

- **Map Saving and Loading**: Achieved the ability to save and load maps, a crucial step for autonomous navigation and future development.
- **Successful Presentation**: Presented our project effectively, receiving positive feedback and concluding the program on a high note.

**Findings:**

- **Nav2 Goal Post Issue**: Identified that the Nav2 goal post feature is not functioning, likely due to the nav goal topic not being published. Future work will need to address this issue to enable autonomous navigation.
- **Importance of Detailed Preparation**: The preparation for the presentation underscored the importance of thorough documentation and clear communication of our work.

**Algorithms Used:**

- **Visual SLAM**: Continued use of visual SLAM algorithms for mapping and localization, fine-tuning parameters for improved performance.
- **Nav2 Navigation**: Although the Nav2 goal post feature is not fully operational, its integration is a key focus for future development.

**Issues and Frustrations:**

- **Nav2 Goal Post Functionality**: The inability to autonomously navigate to specified goals due to issues with the nav goal topic not being published was a significant frustration.
- **Wrapping Up Hardware**: The process of returning hardware and wrapping up in the lab was bittersweet, marking the end of hands-on work for the program.

**Other Relevant Experiences and Insights:**

- **Mentorship and Fellowship**: The final days were marked by reflections on the invaluable mentorship and fellowship experienced throughout the program. The support and guidance from mentors and peers were instrumental in the project's success.
- **Future Plans**: Discussions with advisors and mentors about continuing work during the fall semester highlighted ongoing opportunities for research and development.

**Personal Reflections:**

This week has been a fitting conclusion to a productive and enriching program. The successful mapping and localization, coupled with a well-received presentation, demonstrated the progress made. The mentorship and support provided a nurturing environment for growth and learning. As I look forward to continuing this work in the fall semester, I am grateful for the opportunity and excited about future developments.
