Monday:

Today, we had our first writing workshop. It was engaging and informative. I learned about “coining,” which involves defining our own terms in research papers. Another intriguing concept was the use of language variations (e.g., African English, Hindu English) and how these variations complicate the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). This insight made me realize the complexity of developing LLMs.

Tuesday:

I spent the day getting acclimated to our project, which focuses on developing an autonomous wheelchair. I learned the basics of setting up a Raspberry Pi, including installing the OS and connecting peripherals like a keyboard, mouse, and camera. The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable computer designed to teach basic computer science. I also had the opportunity to discuss Phase 2 of our project with Dr. Naryako and Dr. Scott. This phase involves enabling the wheelchair to navigate indoor spaces automatically using language commands.

Wednesday:

We finished setting up our Raspberry Pi and connected the cameras. I spent time familiarizing myself with various libraries and programs we’ll use, including OpenCV. I created a program using OpenCV to detect a path on a piece of paper by identifying the color black. These mini-projects are improving my fluency in Linux and command line prompting.

Thursday:

Before lunch, I connected to our GitHub repository and explored a repository for using YOLOv8 for object detection. After lunch, I integrated the YOLOv8 model on both my Raspberry Pi and laptop via Ultralytics. I also familiarized myself with Visual Language Maps, which will inspire Phase 2 of the wheelchair project.

Friday:

Today, I familiarized myself with the hardware for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the wheelchair project. I researched a project from Carnegie Mellon that uses visual-language models to automate a robot capable of real-world navigation based on complex language instructions. I also met someone who has gone through the Phase 2 process and received valuable advice and insights about working with my mentors, Dr. Scott, and the project team.
