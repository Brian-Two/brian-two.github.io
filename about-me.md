## About Me
Hello, my name is Brian Too. I am a Rising sophomore at Howard University, located in Washington D.C. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Currently, my focus is on the field of Artificial Intelligence. My passion for technology stems from my drive for innovation and my desire to push modern technology to its next milestone. When I am not focused on tech, I enjoy working out, playing sports, fishing, and reading.
