During the first week, I was welcomed to an orientation to the program and the project that I will be working on for the duration of the program. I was able to meet my group partners who vary in professions, two electrical engineers and one political scientist, and I was able to meet my mentor, a well-accomplished innovator, researcher, and computer scientist.  
	I also participated in the programming and machine learning boot camp this week. I enjoyed the personal project I was given because I got a perfect score on the placement test. It challenged me to apply topics I hadnâ€™t used in a while and refreshed my basic knowledge of data structures. I also enjoyed the introductory lessons on machine learning and data analysis as they helped me feel more confident in some topics I learned very briefly before. We finished the week getting to know our peers better and taking professional headshots and for me, it was a perfect way to end this boot camp week. 
	Overall I am very excited to get started on my project, I enjoy this program and the group I was given and there is not much to complain about.  I want to leave very impactful work by the end of this program and learn more as a researcher, professional, and engineer.
