Monday:

Today was fast-paced and began with our usual writing workshop, which was just as insightful as last week. My biggest takeaway was learning how to properly analyze rather than summarize. After the writing session, our group met to discuss our objectives for the week. The tracked-based team aims to build the first version of an object/segmentation detection model to detect the track and QR code for keeping the wheelchair on track. The SLAM-based navigation team, which I am part of, plans to become acclimated with the technology stack for this method and to begin the mini project. My focus will be on learning more about ROS, Ubuntu, and Linux/Unix to get started on the project.

Tuesday:

After the standup meeting with Dr. Nyarko, I spent the day getting acclimated to phase 2 of the autonomous wheelchair project, which involves the implementation of SLAM. I worked with Dr. Scott and two other volunteers on the SLAM project. I received the necessary documents to replicate a mini project of a robot using SLAM and other helpful resources. I will be getting the pieces to start building the robot on Friday or Monday.

Wednesday:

I dived into my SLAM research and learned a lot about ROS and Ubuntu. From what I found, the only way to become comfortable with ROS is by using it extensively, and Ubuntu is similar to the OS for the Raspberry Pi. We had a meeting on the ethics of AI and its integration into the Black community, specifically focusing on voice detection. After this insightful presentation, I regrouped with the SLAM team and continued working on the mini project. I encountered an issue with downloading a virtual machine on my laptop and will have to switch to dual-booting this project on my laptop or another device.

Thursday:

We had a field trip to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. The trip was very insightful as I connected with someone working on a robotics project similar to the end goal of my project—an autonomous robot that can detect, re-localize, and map its environment. However, to my surprise, they did not use SLAM. I will follow up with that team to gather insightful information and advice that I can bring back to my project.

Friday:

Today, I am working on the mini project. Here are the required components:

	•	Raspberry Pi 4: Acts as the central processing unit.
	•	Waveshare General Driver for Robots: To control the motors and IMU.
	•	DFRobot TT Motor with Encoders: Provides motion and feedback on distance and speed.
	•	2S 18650 LiPo Battery Bank: Power source.
	•	2S 2A Multi-Cell 2S Type-C to 8.4V Step-Up Boost LiPo Polymer Li-Ion Charger: Manages battery charging.
	•	FHL-LD19 DTOF Lidar: For environmental scanning and mapping.
	•	Acrylic 2WD Robot Chassis: Structural framework.

Since I don’t have the pieces needed to start constructing the robot yet, I am going to start part two of this project, which is the software implementation. I am now installing ROS 2 in Ubuntu 22.04 on my Mac. I got the virtual machine to work but now want to dual boot Ubuntu on my Mac because a virtual machine will lead to many networking errors while working on this project.

Accomplishments:

	•	Learned how to analyze rather than summarize in the writing workshop.
	•	Set clear objectives for the SLAM team and my learning goals.
	•	Gained essential documents and resources for the SLAM mini project.
	•	Improved knowledge of ROS and Ubuntu.
	•	Participated in a discussion on the ethics of AI.
	•	Networked with professionals at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.
	•	Listed required components for the SLAM mini project and started software implementation.

Results Achieved:

	•	Defined learning and project objectives for the week.
	•	Acquired foundational knowledge for SLAM implementation.
	•	Improved programming fluency in Linux and command line prompting.
	•	Progressed in software setup for SLAM mini project.

Findings:

	•	Analyzing is more effective than summarizing for in-depth understanding.
	•	Practical experience with ROS and Ubuntu enhances understanding.
	•	Ethical implications of AI need careful consideration.
	•	Networking with professionals provides valuable insights and potential new approaches.

Algorithms Used:

	•	SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

Issues Encountered:

	•	Difficulty in installing a virtual machine; considering dual-booting.
	•	Networking issues with virtual machine setup.

Insights:

	•	Practical hands-on usage is crucial for mastering technical tools.
	•	Networking and learning from other projects can reveal alternative approaches.
	•	Engaging in discussions on ethics broadens understanding of AI’s societal impact.

This week’s activities have significantly advanced my understanding and capabilities in both the technical and theoretical aspects of our project.
